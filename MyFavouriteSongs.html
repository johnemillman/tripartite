&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The 1000 or so  Songs  listed below (in Parts 1 and 2) are those I've enjoyed most, but whether because of the particular artists by whom I've heard them performed (mainly on record), or because of the intrinsic quality of the songs, is hard to say.  Not included are a number of compositions of obvious merit once enjoyed, which no longer prove as satisfying.  These are often the slow 'standard' ballads - eg by Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, Richard Rodgers, etc - as, say:  Blues Skies, I Concentrate On You, Long ago and Far Away.  Cole Porter's Night and Day might fall in this category but it's included because it was once a firm favourite in my youth.   There are a number of others of similar borderline status - some included, some not.  Such quality songs have probably suffered from over-exposure, even if that was now  decades ago.  Always, by Irving Berlin, is another in this group but the version by Ella Fitzgerald rescues it.  And, admittedly, Chet Baker does a great job on Long Ago and Far Away. These composers have of course contributed many other wondeful tunes that <i>are</i> included in the lists.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
       Other tunes having less interest than previously are the novelty songs - as Kalamazoo, Maresie Dotes, etc (or any modern equivalents) and those with an overly  fast tempo - such as Tea for Two, How High The Moon, Fascinatin' Rhythm, etc - which, while attractive, have simple, repetitive themes, devoid of much melodic variation - played primarily for their fast rhythmic effects.  A borderline number in this regard, which is included, is Them There Eyes - but Billie Holiday could sing the telephone book and I'd love it.  Since about 1965, the bulk of new popular music ('pop' or 'rock') is often, but not always, devoid of significant melody (in my estimation), relying mostly on one instrument (the guitar) or artificial synthesiser rhythms and rather mediocre, repetitive lyrics of limited quality.  Well, whatever sells...  And much of modern jazz over that same period seems to focus on ever more intricate harmony, with more intellectual than emotional content.  Technical cleverness, not feeling (other than 'assertiveness', which characterises so much of 'bop'), too often predominates.  Good music is surely an integrated, coherent balance of all three elements - rhythm, harmony and particularly melody - with capacity to evoke emotional response.  But, to each his own... I realize that many devotees of recent rock/pop find as much melody as well as that ubiquitous rhythm in their favourites, as do I in mine.  And while agreeing with Wynton Marsalis that good jazz should always 'swing', it should also, I believe, express some warmth or feeling as well; something that suggests that the artist has experienced 'life' -  beyond music college.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        Lyrics are a special kind of poetry - which require rhythm and melody for their aesthetic effects - but with the melody, the music of a song, seen here as the slightly more fundamental element - even where it benefits from those lyrics.  In the best songs, the lyrics and melody blend together seamlessly to stir various emotions - sometimes mild, sometimes profound.  This contrasts with simple, toe-tapping  rhythm numbers that only 'arouse' - in a general sense.  Equally, some of the classic slow ballads, while possessing flowing melody and fitting lyrics, often evoke more rational than emotional effects - even though they are ostensibly love songs, typically;  A bit two dimensional maybe.  I would be hard pressed, however, to explain why the marriage of melody and lyric in such songs as You've Changed, I Didn't Know About You or You're Always There - as sung by Anne Shelton, Mildred Bailey and Kay Starr, respectively - evoke deeper emotion in me than an admittedly excellent tune such as Long Ago and Far Away - beautifully sung as it may be - by Kathryn Grayson, say.<p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    [Since writing the above, one has become more aware of just how universal and popular is the idea of producing a list of one's favourite songs.  Enter that phrase into a good search engine (as Google) and it shows over 400,000 entries!  How naive, therefore, to think that more than a sprinkling of others would ever find their way to a given list (say number 87,432 or whatever) by a cursory search.  And, as an veoldieve myself, it is even more obvious to me now that it is the 'pop' songs - of the '70's, '80's and 90's  (and now the noughties) that vastly predominate in such lists. I suppose that focusing oneves search onto specific categories - as jazz, classics, blues, country, or vethe American popular songve (which Ived always assumed referred to standards written mainly in the '30's to '50's), might eliminate some of this over-whelming avalanche of popular youthful taste.  Ivem sure thereves a good thesis to be written (if it hasn't already) onthe 'critical period' in one's life/youth when the music of the times is maximally conditioned or integrated into an optimally responsive musical/emotional/peer-pressure system.  I imagine this must be around the age of 20 (+ or - 4 years, say) for most people.  Later, they can be exposed to the favourites of a different genre or age and it will likely register  little or no interest -  just disdain, while their own preferences have been cast in concrete for life - no doubt including mine.  It's more a function of contemporary culture and a desire to be a part of the latest esoteric scene.  I suppose it was ever thus.]<p> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  But one mustn't generalize.  There's been a tendency in some circles to castigate the music of the  '50s, say, as vesentimental, gushy papve - from the 'pop' scene of the day especially (ie the hit parade then).  And much of it was just that; there must be millions of people who enjoy the odd nostalgia programs which play such music of that era.  I am not myself one of them.  Like the music produced by pop idols and the ubiquitous groups of today, I never listened much to all that then nor now. And yet, I certainly did enjoy hundreds of <u>other</u> great perfomances made in the '50s - by such as Nat Cole, Frank Sinatra, Louis Armtrong, Sarah Vaughan, Billie Eckstine, Mel Torme, Kay Starr, Carmen McRae, Lee Wiley, George Shearing, Jack Teagarden (and other jazz instrumentalists), etc.  Equally, there has of course been <i>some</i> good material written since the '70s and 50 years from now, someone will still appreciate it - as others will prefer the more popular material of today (in which, I must admit, there is sometimes <i>some</i> melody).  And can so many millions be wrong?  Jazz, and much of vemy kind of musicve - often on the edge of jazz - must it seems remain a minority interest.  Who's heard of Freddie Gardner or Maxine Sullivan?]<p>

<b>Note:</b>   Titles of songs and tunes in the Lists below preceded by one to three asterisks (*) denote particular favourites - at least at present; tastes do alter and vary with mood.  An (N) beside an entry - with a year - indicates that its choice may have been influenced as much by Nostalgia as by musical merit, although it's often both.  I've tried to show the Composer and Lyricist in that order, if known, after each title, although in some cases both (or more) parties have contributed to both elements.  Some names may be in the wrong order and not all first names are (presently) known.  The names of performers shown in square brackets are those I know have recorded enjoyable versions of the number concerned; there are no doubt others of equal merit.  Space dictates that not all can be mentioned here, nor the CDs, LPs, etc in which they occur.  A red symbol (<font color="red">#</font>) before a performerves name indicates (for my own information) that I have that version as an mp3 file, or in some other format. [Only a portion of the former category has been so verified thus far; those held on CD, LP and cassette will also be  analysed subsequently; I intend eventually to transfer these to mp3 form as well.] <p>
   I hope to build up a  collection of the lyrics, including the often excellent verses, if written, to all the songs on the list but this is even more labour intensive. Some of these have now been included and may be brought up by clicking on ve<font color="blue">Lyrics</font>ve, where shown.  The lists will also include a few lyricless 'tunes' - as performed by various jazz players in particular - as eg  Struttin' With Some Barbecue, Potato Head Blues, Theme from The Bad & the Beautiful, etc.  Finally, some years after this list was first compiled, a website has emerged listing the 1000 most popular veJazz Standardsve very many of which were already on my original lists here. I have placed the ranking number of same (based on an American poll) just before my titles - in brackets - as: [34], say. If one of my choices does not appear on their list, the bracket will appear instead as [?] and signify some unknown ranking beyond 1000. Equally, many of the numbers on their list are not included in mine although these are ranked mostly beyond 500. In addition, another excellent and relevant resource that did not exist until more recently is at: en.wikipedia/wiki/Jazz_standard .<p>

<center><b><u>A Blosson Fell</u></b> - by ............ <p>
A Blossom fell...from off a tree; it settled softly on the lips you turn to me.<br> The gypsies say and I know why - veA falling blossom only touches lips that lieve.<br> A blossom fell...and very soon, I saw you kissing someone new beneath the moon.<br>  I thought you loved me; you said you loved me. We planned together, to dream forever.<br> The dream has ended, for true love died - the night a blossom fell and touched two lips that lied.</center><p><p>

You must remember this - a kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh.<br> The fundamental things apply - as time goes by.<p>And when two lovers woo, they still say veI love youve; on that you can rely - <br>No matter what the future brings, as time goes by.<p>Moonlight and love songs never out of date,<br>Hearts full of passion, jealousy and hate.<br>Woman needs man, and man must have his mate - <br>That no one can deny.<p>Itves still the same old story, a fight for love and glory,<br>A case of do or die.<br>The world will always welcome lovers - As time goes by.<p>

<u>1st verse</u>  [Note: Certain performers sing parts only of the verses - and in various orders.]<p><center>
Life is very rough and tumble for a humble deserves<br> One can betray oneves troubles never - whatever occurs. <p> Night after night you have to look bright - whether youvere well or ill<br> People must have their fill; you mustnvet sleep till dawn comes creeping.<p> Though I never really grumble, lifeves a jumble indeed<br> And in my efforts to succeed, Iveve had to formulate a Creed:</center><p>
<u>Chorus</u><p><center>
I believe in doing what I can, <br> In crying when I must, <br> In laughing when I choose.<br>Hey Ho - If Love were all...<br> I should be lonely.<p> I believe the more you love a man, <br> The more you give your trust, <br> The more youvere bound to lose. <br> Although, when shadows fall, I think if only...<br>Somebody splendid really needed me ;<br> Someone affectionate and dear, <br> Cares would be ended if I knew that he<br>Wanted to have..me..near.  <p>
But I believe that since my life began...<br> The most Iveve had is just..a talent to amuse;<br> Hey Ho, If love were all.</center><p>
<u>2nd verse</u><p> <center>
Though Life buffets me obscenely, It serenely goes on<br> Although I question its conclusion, illusion is gone.<p>Frequently, I put a bit by - safe for a rainy day<br> Nobody here can say to what indeed<br> The years are leading<p> Though fate often treats me meanly, <br>I serenely pursue<br> A little mirage in the blue.<br> Determination helps me through.</center>  [Note: This is usually followed by a<p>

             That itves such a pity.    We never met before.<br>
           What an awful pity  We never, never met before.</center> <p>
